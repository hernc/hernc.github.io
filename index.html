					<h1>SPACE</h1>
					<P>Choose a space nearby to explore. The space may be as small as a closet or as large as a classroom. Make a list of the intended functions of the space. If there are alternative ways to use the space separate from its intended use, list those as well. Observe how you move through the space and think about how your presence activates its functions. Once you have considered all possible functions of the space, organize them in order of intended uses down to alternative uses. Describe the procedures necessary to carry out each function. Thoroughly document the space and each function using photography. Finally, construct a brief slide presentation that documents the space in an efficient and poetic manner.
