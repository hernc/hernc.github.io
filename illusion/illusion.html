					the nature is what it is, irrespective of any meaning or interpretation <em> attached </em>to it by the human mind.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterz">z</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						The fundamental problem of illusions <em>seizing</em> the individual’s awareness is the resulting reluctance to see things as they are and to be seen without illusions.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterb">b</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						The human mind is confined to the <em>brain</em>, which is full of limitations and which inhibits the mind from a detached perspective. The mind does not have direct contact with reality. The limits imposed on human senses and tools that extend them allow a perception of only a small portion of reality.
					</p>
				<li class="letters lettery">y</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						Thus, the human mind is constrained, both <em>physically and conceptually</em>, by its limitations and programming. In effect, the physical and mental states of being determine what one thinks or how one perceives and interprets reality.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterc">c</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						it is not always <em>clear</em> whether one arrives at a deeper understanding of reality or just moves from one illusion to another.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterx">x</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						The complexity of interactions between the billions of neurons in the brain is enormous, and the dynamics of these interactions is constantly changing in response to <em>external</em> and internal influences, generating new thoughts and choices.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterd">d</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						There is no <em>definitive</em> answer to the question of what reality is. In broadest terms, one can define reality as all that exists, irrespective of whether or not it can be observed or understood.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterw">w</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						Time does not exist as an objective physical reality; it is a human construct that provides a context to the constantly changing <em>world</em>. In fact, what one experiences throughout life is not time itself, but change; and every device used to measure time is based on measuring change. But the illusion of the reality of time is so ingrained in the human mind that life is perceived as a flow through time. And as that time is finite for the mortal human, it is the most precious attribute of life.
					</p>
				<li class="letters lettere">e</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						Although it seems that the laws of nature and the universe are suitable for the <em>emergence</em> of life, cosmic evolution appears indifferent to human survival. Thus, one may inquire whether there is any inherent meaning or purpose to the universe and human life, or whether the emergence of life and human intelligence is nothing more than an <em>evolutionary</em> accident.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterv">v</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						The human mind struggles to grasp reality, but in practical terms can only generate <em>various</em> concepts and theories that have their limitations.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterf">f</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						The limits of existence, cognitive biases, and the boundaries of understanding can result in illusions, which can be perceived as reality. These are the illusions of knowledge and understanding, of faith and certainty, of time and eternity, of <em>freedom</em> and <em>free will</em>, and of the meaning of life.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letteru">u</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						<em>Ultimate</em> reality cannot be defined by concepts or words. The ultimate truth may not even exist. Moreover, the ultimate reality is unreachable, as it is uncertain how much of reality is completely unknown or inaccessible to human reason and understanding.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterg">g</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						<em>B.G. Yacobi</em>"The Author" has a PhD in physics. He held research positions at Imperial College London and Harvard University, as well as teaching positions in universities in the United States and Canada.
					</p>
				<li class="letters lettert">t</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						Whether one <em>thinks</em> in terms of trees and rocks or atomic particles and light quanta, their reality appears to human observers as a partial representation of the ultimate reality.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterh">h</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						<em>Human</em> beings are caught between illusion and reality, as the mind dwells in the subjective world of ideas and concepts, but physically one exists in the world of objective reality that cannot be directly experienced or fully understood.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letters">s</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						Concepts, the building blocks of theories, are <em>structured</em> ideas that can be communicated using symbolic systems such as natural language or mathematics. Concepts and theories are human constructs; they have no independent existence outside of the mind and are always partial and provisional.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letteri">i</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						<em>Illusions</em> offer existential comfort, but they may also result in a reluctance to see things as they are and to be seen without illusions.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterr">r</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						This is further complicated by the use of <em>reason</em> and logic to guide the mind to truth, as they rely on language that is inadequate for describing reality
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterj">j</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						It is uncertain how much of reality is completely unknown or inaccessible to human senses, tools, reasoning, and language. In the final analysis, one can never be certain of the direct correspondence between theory and reality. One can only <em>judge</em> any theory on the basis of its predictive ability.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterq">q</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						The <em>question</em> is whether words represent reality, or a concept of reality, or reduced representations of reality, or whether words and language may even generate separate realities.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterk">k</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						<em>Knowingly</em> or unknowingly, the human tendency is to distort reality to make it more endurable. The human mind is steered towards illusions that are adaptable to one’s needs and desires. It is difficult to tell where reality ends and illusions begin, as the transition between them is often unclear and inconsistent.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterp">p</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						<em>Physical</em> reality is defined as extended in space, having physical properties such as mass, and existing independently of the observer.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterl">l</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						The human perception of the world is shaped by <em>language</em>. But both language and understanding of reality through any form of language are fundamentally limited.
					</p>
				<li class="letters lettero">o</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						Concepts tend to confine the human mind. The dilemma is that one must
                        both develop concepts and doubt them, and one must both learn and unlearn in order to make some sense of reality. <em>Otherwise</em>, one is constrained by incomplete concepts and is left with illusions of understanding.
					</p>
				<li class="letters letterm">m</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						<em>Mental</em> reality has no extension in space and exists only in the minds of individuals, with its existence depending on the observer.
					</p>
				<li class="letters lettern">n</li>
				<p class="innerIllusion">
						<em>Nature</em> is neither moral nor immoral; it is indifferent to human concepts and desires. The world is constantly changing, and human life is a continuous chain of intertwined random events and is thus largely unpredictable.
