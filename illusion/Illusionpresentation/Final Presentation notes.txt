**ILLUSION TYPEFACE**
Good morning My presentation has a backwards flow and it doesn’t follow the usual format but hopefully it will come together by the end. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**ILLUSION**
 The name is still a work in progress. “UMBRA” is latin for shadow is one I’ve been thinking about. 

-It is a unique display design
 chamfered corners give the font an industrial feel
-I think it questions  strength, solidity ,character & dimension.

-the dark side is dominant, and often you see more light than shadow.

- attracts attention in display settings,
& may also be legible in short display blocks.

**BASE  CLASSIFICATION**

I wanted to show those basic numbers that we have all become so familiar with in this process. X-height, Cap height, etc… the bones of the face!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**CHAMFER**
WHY CHAMFER?
It has historical ties with large-scale lettering: traditional sign painters often use simple polygonal letterforms when working large, since they can be scaled up more easily using a systematic grid, requiring fewer calculations for curves. this systematic quality was very present in the concept of the typeface so it fit well.  
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**DECISIONS**
Some of the decisions which help in defining the typeface characters are; the angles 120º and 60º which are not used in the same order or placements throughout the typeface as other fonts. not  all corners have an angle as is the base idea behind most of the chamfered typefaces. I struggled with this rule and sticking to it didn’t make sense in all glyphs.  
 
 The stem is also the same weight when used as a diagonal , horizontal stem, or crossbars.    

The measurements used for the outline and inset are intended to interact with the visibility of the shadow form & it’s dimension. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 

**ERRORS**
Erroneous moves during design process.!! I’m sure we all have those details that bug us. my typeface suffers from many of these. 
The opening counter in the D 
as well as the sharp contrast inside the W between the angles and horizontal lines. 
the chosen angle on the J is off balance due to the direction of the letter.
 the number 7 is completely off the grid and does not share logic with its family. 
 the letter E middle crossbar lack of angles creates tension
 ETC….
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**FORM**
Rectangular forms, in different weights are used as base elements of the typeface. By playing with these elements the illusion of depth is portrayed. and some light dark forms present themselves  

This unknown quote made me look at the shapes in order to create the form.  crazy!

**GRECIAN**
By now you have realized the alphabetical nature of my presentation and are realizing how this is probably one of those times I did not want to get rid of an idea –as we often do– but I couldn’t see myself starting with H for the sake of history setting a context.  SO here are some examples of the historical reference. 

Grecian: A typically heavy display typeface with octagonal shapes where curves are normally used. Also known as Chamfered or Beveled. Popular in the 19th Century for wood types.

This kind of Grecian style rose to prominence during the 1800s. At the time, type founders were doing all sorts of strange and wonderful things with letterforms, mostly to service the field of advertising. 

most of these specimens don’t have names and simply are numbered. all are from the later 1800’s
**on the:**
**left**— the expanded showing of Page’s Grecian Double Extra Condensed in the 8-line and 10-line sizes
**right**—Nº 10. — 8 cicéros from Imprimerie Suisse’s “Spécimen des Caractères”, 1892.
			Example of a Grecian from The WM. H. Page Wood Type Co. Specimen facsimile, 1888.
			Identified only as No. 1229, this is a typeface from the French typefoundry of Peignot, as it appeared in their Lettres Fantaises of 1896.

**HISTORY**
The impact of technology on printing, paper manufacturing, and mechanical typesetting created a demand for a new style in type design that was compatible with mass-production.

Print journalism and advertising demanded types that were not only readable, but bold and distinctive enough to catch the reader’s attention.
the **DISPLAY** was born. 

**ON THE RIGHT— BROADWAY**
In 1928 Morris Fuller Benton applied geometry to the Modern letterform to arrive at Broadway.

**INDUSTRILIZATION**

 Industrial manufacturing created a need to promote the sale of ready-made goods which aided in the development of advertisement which aided all sort of things on and on… 
 
 So in a sense I went  back to the industrialization idea and created something which in my mind has a bit of industrial spirit both in form but also in the creation process. 
 
 In this context,  the characteristics of this typeface connect to the concepts of industrialization. the manufacturing of parts from a specific set of forms to deliver a final product.
 I see the form of this type as well as it’s concept–in a satirical way–being able to bring attention to industrialization and consumption issues. 
 
  **OR JUST SOME POSTER ON BEHANCE OR DRIBBBLE WOULD BE KINDA COOL TOO.  THANKS**
