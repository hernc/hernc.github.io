					"Display typography is a potent element in graphic design, where there is less concern for readability and more potential for using type in an artistic manner. A display typeface is designed for the use of type at large sizes, perhaps 30 points or larger."

               <p class="description">
                  This was perhaps one of the main reasoning behind the construction of this typeface. I wanted a type that could stand up to the abundance and enormous sizes of attention grabbing elements out in our presence daily. Theoretically, this would allow the typeface to become part of the message, by inheriting some of the charachteristics of the content.
