        <p>Archive the progression of jowells piano lessons.attach a session to each letter and mark the progression by attaching later sessions to higher   characters such as first session = A and fifth session would be = E. </p>
        <p> Possibly start with new songs instead of known songs to ba able to capture the full progression</p>
        <p>basically show Jowells progress in each song by attaching the sound of his progress to a letter of the alphabet</p>
