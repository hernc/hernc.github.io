            <p><span class="headers">JOSALIE 1984</span></br></br>This particular girl told me that her Aunt was the one who named her.  Her aunt combined her dad&#39;s name (Jose) and her mom&#39;s name (Lila) to form Josalie.  She personally dislikes her name, because people pronounce it the wrong way all of the time.  They pronounce it Jocelyn or Ja-solie.  She wishes they would have went with something simple like Jolie, or just something completely different.  When I first asked her name she told me it was Josie, which is the name she prefers.</p>

                <p><span class="headers">THOUGHTS:</span></br></br>I thought this was interesting, it&#39;s rare I meet people who dislike their name.  I guess everyone could find a problem with his or her own name.   Take me for example, although my name is not terrible and can be easily pronounced, I just feel like there is always a Hispanic guy named Carlos and 90 percent of the time it&#39;s me! However, I do like the fact that my name is never mispronounced and for short people have called me Carl or Los, which I do not mind.</p>
