            <p><span class="headers">LICIT</span></br></br>I met a woman on the bus one day.  I explained to her that I was doing a project for school and wanted to know if she would like to participate. All I needed was her name and a brief story behind it, if she had one.  She told me her name was Licit, which is pronounced Lissette.  She told me that her mom did not know English, when she came from Puerto Rico.  After giving birth to her, she wanted to name her Lissette, but did not know how to spell it, so she did the best she could, hence the name Licit.  She told me when people would see her name, they would either pronounce it Lick it or Li-sit.  She likes her name, but just wishes it was spelt correctly.

            <p><span class="headers">THOUGHTS:</span></br></br>I felt sort of bad for Licit&#39;s mother and Licit for that matter.  Perhaps, someone in the hospital should have told her mother the correct spelling or explain to her that Lissette is not spelt Licit.  Why didn&#39;t anyone tell her mother? Why didn&#39;t her own family tell her?  These are questions I asked her, but Licit could not answer, because she did not know.  She never cared to ask her mother, they were not so close.  If my name were spelt wrong, I would have probably changed it by now.  Overall, she told me it&#39;s been that way for so long, she got use to the spelling and figured why change it now.  She was right, why change it now, plus when you tell someone your name, unless they ask for the spelling, whatever you tell them to call you, is what they will call you.</p>
