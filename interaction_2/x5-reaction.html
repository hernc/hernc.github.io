            <p><span class="headers">KAYDEE</span></br></br>Kaydee&#39;s mom liked the name Katie, but she decided to spell it a little bit different.   Kaydee&#39;s mom is named Haydee; so she thought why not replace the H with a K, to form Kaydee.  Kaydee told me that her mom named her sister the same way.  Kaydee&#39;s sister is named Saydee.  So now you have Haydee, Kaydee and Saydee.</p>

            <p>Kaydee had an interesting story and the fact that her mother wanted a whole dynasty of aydee&#39;s is sort of amazing.  Some may call it creativity, others sheer laziness.   I don&#39;t know what to call it.  It&#39;s sort of creative, because her mother took the time to think about it and obviously her mother loved her name so much she wanted both of her daughter&#39;s to have a part of it.  On the other hand, it could be seen as lacking creativity, because all her mother really did was change the first letter of her name, twice.  How easy is that!</p>
