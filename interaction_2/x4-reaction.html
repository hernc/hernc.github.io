            <p><span class="headers">HOLIE</span></br>Hollie had an interesting story.  Her grandparents were married for many years and were very much in love, unfortunately her grandpa died before Holly was born (she did not go into detail as to what happened to her grandpa, maybe it was too tragic and I didn’t dare ask).  So when her mother found out she was having a girl, her grandma thought she should name the baby Hollie, after her grandpa.  Her Grandpa’s name was Ollie Tinnie, so her grandma thought of the name Hollie and middle name Tinnie.  Hollie told me that her brother is having a baby, and he wants to name her Tinnie Lee.</p>

            <p><span class="headers">THOUGHTS:</span></br>This was a great story.  Her grandma loved her grandpa so much; she wanted her granddaughter to be named after him. He must have been a great dad and husband.  Perhaps if I had an influential family member in my life, my son would have a different name today.  This would actually make the task of naming your child MUCH easier.  I remember how difficult it was for my wife and I to pick a name for my son, nothing was good enough.  Come to think of it, naming your child after a family doesn’t seem like a bad idea after all, and it can save you lots of time.</p>
