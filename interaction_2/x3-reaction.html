            <p><span class="headers">CONRAD</span></br></br>Although he told me his name was Conrad, his real name is Thomas. His middle name is Conrad. However, ever since he could remember his family and friends called him Conrad. His dad wanted to name him Thomas, after himself, but his mom loved the name Conrad, because that was the name of her favorite uncle.  So in order to please his dad, his mother named him Thomas Conrad.</p>

            <p><span class="headers">THOUGHTS</span></br></br>I can relate to this story in a sense that I know a few people, who have been named after someone their parents loved: whether it was a family member, a friend, a famous person, a drink (believe it or not!), etc. Like Conrad, I too was named after a family member, my great grandfather, whom I never met by the way, however he must have been liked enough, or else my name would not be Carlos.   I actually have a middle name as well, however in my case, no one really knows it.  I do not tell anyone, because I do not feel the need to, I feel my first name is good enough.  Nevertheless, for the sake of this project, I will reveal it. My middle name is Arturo, which is the name Arthur in English.  Come to think of it, I may start to use Arturo, why not? After all, it is my name.</p>
