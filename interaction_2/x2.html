            <p><span class="headers">LICIT</span></br></br>What&#39;s in a name&#63;  You would be surprised how many people I met that can tell you a story behind why they were given their name.   Take for example, a woman I met on the bus one day.  I explained to her that I was doing a project for school and wanted to know if she would like to participate. All I needed was her name and a brief story behind it, if she had one.  She told me her name was Licit, which is pronounced Lissette.  She told me that her mom did not know English, when she came from Puerto Rico.  After giving birth to her, she wanted to name her lissette, but did not know how to spell it, so she did the best she could, hence the name Licit.  She told me when people would see her name, they would either pronounce it Lick it or Li-sit.
