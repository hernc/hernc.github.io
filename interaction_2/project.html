                <p>Obviously this project had to have a beggining. Usually in an attempt to interact, one must present oneself to others. It may be overlooked at times, but one's identity is the beggining of it all. without it, how would you introduce yourself? Identifying someone by name is done everyday, however it is often done unconsiously. In this project we will attempt to gather the make up of our names. through interacting with passangers we can find out the unique stories behind the ever present name.</br>
                    What&#39;s in a name?  You would be surprised how many people have a story to tell about their name.   While traveling on the bus, I would see so many people getting off and on, but to me they were nameless, just strangers either going to school, work, etc.  I thought it would be interesting to put a name with a face, and get into some of their minds, and not just look at them as passengers on a bus, but someone I could relate to.   After speaking to few people, I gained a new perspective on people who travel on the bus.
