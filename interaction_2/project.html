                <p>Obviously this project had to have a beggining. Usually in an attempt to interact, one must present oneself to others. It may be overlooked at times, but one's identity is the beggining of it all. without it, how would you introduce yourself? Identifying someone by name is done everyday, however it is often done unconsiously. In this project we will attempt to gather the make up of our names. through interacting with passangers we can find out the unique stories behind the ever present, the name.  </p>
