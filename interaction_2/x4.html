            <p><span class="headers">HOLIE</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="arrow">&#10144;</span></br></br>Hollie had an interesting story.  Her grandparents were married for many years and were very much in love, unfortunately her grandpa died before Holly was born (she did not go into detail as to what happened to her grandpa, maybe it was too tragic and I didn’t dare ask).  So when her mother found out she was having a girl, her grandma thought she should name the baby Hollie, after her grandpa.  Her Grandpa’s name was Ollie Tinnie, so her grandma thought of the name Hollie and middle name Tinnie.  Hollie told me that her brother is having a baby, and he wants to name her Tinnie Lee.</p>
